A game that is a "modified" version of the known game: WORDLE. The twist, is that it is about soccer players. 
We have a database of famous soccer players and it will randomly pick one every 24hours and the user will see the guesses with each guess adding an option to reveal a hint and prompts the user to keep guessing until they have guessed the correct player of the day.

Following the guessing game, there is an unlimited mode for users to continue playing as much as they desire.
We have a leaderboard that showcases the top players and there is one for daily and one for all time to showcase users and let them brag about it.
We do plan on implementing more additional modes/features as the development progresses

The user will have 6 guesses, and there will be a stats page representing the user's stat distributions alongside other features
